Projects combining multiple disparate components, like this one, are problematic
from a licensing perspective. As a result, I am licensing different components
under different licenses, as follows:

moderncvcolorbluecustom.sty and moderncvstylebankingcustom.sty
   I am licensing my modifications under the original license, the LaTeX Project
   Public License version 1.3c. See the header of each file for details.

resume.yml
   This is the content of my personal resume, so I don't want anyone
   distributing modified versions. As a result, I am licensing it
   under the `CC BY-ND 4.0 license
   <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/>`_. Of course, you
   can write your own file that serves the same purpose for you.

all other files
   I am licensing these under the `GPL v2+
   <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html>`_.
   
Feel free to ask if you'd like for me to release any of these files to
you under another license; I'll probably be happy to do so.
